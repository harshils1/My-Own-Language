Hey everyone! You chose to read about my very own programming language repo! Below are some details if you would like to know more about the development process:

# Why did I make this?: 

Wanting to know more about how a language such as C++ or Java works, I took it upon myself to want to make my own. This was a very challenging task, and definitely could not
do this on my own. Therefore, I followed CodePulse's channel to guide and help me through this process.

# Technologies/Languages Used:

- Python
- Object Oriented Programming

# Problems/Challenges Faced and What I Learned:

To be honest, this was pretty difficult. Firstly, I am more of a Java/C++ person, so learning Python (although not as hard to move to), some syntactical and OOP differences were
there. The actual OOP concepts, however, were understandable. Next, understanding how a language works took some time to understand as well. I needed knowledge on Trees, Lexer 
for tokenization, Parser for executable code, interpreter, etc. However, the tutorial was very helpful and reading some side documentation aided as well.

# What's next?:

I hope to add more functionality (e.g, a modulus operator) and overall, make this a more complex language.
